            <p>Rockstar Games, Inc. is an American video game publisher based in New York City. 
                The company was established in December 1998 as a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive, 
                using the assets Take-Two had previously acquired from BMG Interactive. Founding members of the company were Terry Donovan,
                 Gary Foreman, Dan and Sam Houser, and Jamie King, who worked for Take-Two at the time, 
                 and of which the Houser brothers were previously executives at BMG Interactive. 
                 Sam Houser heads the studio as president.
                 Since 1999, several companies acquired by or established under Take-Two have become part of Rockstar Games, 
                 such as Rockstar Canada (later renamed Rockstar Toronto) becoming the first one in 1999, and Rockstar Dundee 
                 the most recent in 2020. All companies organized under Rockstar Games bear the "Rockstar" name and logo. 
                 In this context, Rockstar Games is sometimes also referred to as Rockstar New York, Rockstar NY or Rockstar NYC.
                  Rockstar Games also sports a motion capture studio in Bethpage, New York</p></canvas>

          <p>Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. 
            It is the seventh main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV,
             and the fifteenth instalment overall. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, 
             based on Southern California, the single-player story follows three protagonists—retired bank robber Michael De Santa, 
             street gangster Franklin Clinton, and drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips—and their
              attempts to commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful criminals. 
              The open world design lets players freely roam San Andreas' open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos,
               based on Los Angeles.</p>

         <p>The three protagonists in Grand Theft Auto 5 are Franklin, Michael, and Trevor, and 
            they each have interesting personality traits, skills they start out with, and special abilities to use.
             Although skills can be increased over time, each protagonist has a base set of skills that influence how certain
              aspects of the game are played. The three protagonists also have special abilities that can't be changed and vary in usefulness.

            The story in GTA 5 switches between Franklin, Michael, and Trevor as the three pull off heists, betray each other, 
            and work together to stay alive and out of prison. As the story progresses, the relationships between the three characters grow and
             change, creating a more immersive, and often tense, atmosphere. Generally, Franklin is the voice of reason, Michael is the hothead,
              and Trevor is the wild card.</p>

            <p>Franklin, Michael, and Trevor all have traits that make them better or worse than each other, 
                but the best GTA 5 protagonist has the most enjoyable character traits, the best story, and the most useful skills. 
                There are some sections of GTA 5 that are more fun to play than others, and they tend to revolve around the same character.
                However, each protagonist has enjoyable moments throughout GTA 5, and Franklin, Michael, and 
                Trevor all grow in some way by the end of the story.
                From the start of GTA 5, Franklin comes across as a person who is just trying to get ahead and find a way to lead an honest
                 and respectable life. At every turn, he seems to fight against a life of crime with his childhood friend, Lamar,
                  but he goes along with a lot of what Michael and Trevor ask him to do. Although he shows some resistance to Michael's or Trevor's wilder schemes,
                   he generally follows them and even befriends them, developing somewhat of a mentor-mentee relationship with Michael.
